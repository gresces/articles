## Anastasia's Mate
Anastasia's Mate is a great example of how a knight and rook can cooperate to checkmate the opponent’s king on the side of the board.

Anastasia's Mate Example 1
--------------------------

The first example illustrates the fundamental idea of Anastasia's [checkmate pattern](https://chessfox.com/checkmate-patterns/).

1.Rh3# checkmates the black king against the side of the board. Note how white’s knight is perfectly placed to cover the escape squares.

Anastasia's Mate Example 2
--------------------------

_Diagram above:_ White plays 1.Rd8# This variation of Anastasia's Mate reminds us of the [Back Rank Mate.](https://chessfox.com/back-rank-checkmate/) In this case white’s knight covers the opposing king’s escape squares instead of his own pawns.

Anastasia's Mate Puzzle
-----------------------

The Anastasia's Mate puzzle below is from the game Hammer vs. Carlsen, Halkidiki, Greece, 2003. See if you can find the mate in 2 moves.

Anastasia's Mate Puzzle. Black to play. Can you find mate in two moves?

_Note:_ It is of course much easier to solve a checkmate puzzle if you know what to look for. In a real game you don’t have the luxury of being told that the checkmate is there. However, a good knowledge of checkmate patterns will increase your chances to find such opportunities during your own games.

Solution below:

_Diagram above:_ Carlsen plays 1… Qh5+ and white is forced to capture the queen with 2.gxh5. However, this opens up the 4th rank for black’s rook and allows black to demonstrate a checkmate that is based on Anastacia’s mating pattern.

_Diagram above:_ Black plays 2… Rh4# The point is that black’s knight on e2 covers the escape-square, g1.

### Interesting Note on Anastasia's Mate

[Chess Coach Clark](http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1036807) has a collection of actual games that feature Anastacia’s Mate.

This checkmate pattern is very similar to some variations of [Greco’s Mate](https://chessfox.com/grecos-mate/), which features a bishop cutting off the king’s escape-square, instead of a knight.

Anastasia's Mate got its name from the book “_Anastasia und das Schachspiel”_ (Anastasia and the Game of Chess).
