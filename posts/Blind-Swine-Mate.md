## Blind Swine Mate

The Blind Swine Mate is a [checkmate pattern](https://chessfox.com/checkmate-patterns/) that demonstrates the power of two connected rooks on the 7th rank. It’s often impossible to defend against this checkmate pattern–which is why you should be very aware of the danger presented by two connected rooks on the 7th rank.

Blind Swine Mate Example 1
--------------------------

_Diagram above:_ 1.Rdg7# illustrates the checkmate pattern. The two white rooks on the 7th rank coordinate to trap the castled king, with the “help” of the obstructing black rook on f8.

Blind Swine Mate Example 2
--------------------------

The next example demonstrates how difficult it is two stop two rooks on the 7th rank. The position is from the game [Swiderski – Nimzowitsch, 1905 (example by lichess)](https://lichess.org/practice/checkmates/checkmate-patterns-i/fE4k21MW/iBm9kQPO).

_Diagram above:_ 1.Rg7+ Kh8 2.Rcc7 gets the two rooks on the 7th rank and there is nothing black can do to defend against the coming checkmate.

_Diagram above:_ White plays 2.Rcc7! White is threatening 3.Rh7 Kh8 4.Rcg7#

Black can only delay the eventual outcome, but he cannot prevent it.

_Diagram above:_ 2… Nd7 is a futile attempt to defend against the checkmate, but after 3.Rcxd7 Rf7 4.Rcxf7 there is still nothing black can do to prevent the checkmate.

_Diagram above:_ Black tried desperately to find a way out, but now its clear they can’t prevent Rh7+, Kg8 Rfg7# (Note the help of white’s knight to cover the f8-square)

### Interesting Notes on the Blind Swine Mate

According to this article on [chesskid.com](https://www.chesskid.com/article/view/blind-swine-mate), this checkmate pattern got its name from David Janowski, a Polish grandmaster who referred to a pair of rooks on the seventh rank that could not find a mate as “blind swine”, implying that they should be able to find mate.

An interesting article [by chessbase](https://en.chessbase.com/post/edward-winter-presents-unsolved-che-mysteries-21), also adds ‘Nimzowitsch called a pair of rooks on the opponent’s second rank “blind pigs” because they devour everything indiscriminately.’
